As the holidays approach, many New Yorkers take the lead in spreading cheer by hosting a decadent party. Others enjoy being the guest at countless happy hours and buffets. But, both host and guest may similarly struggle with staying healthy throughout the holiday season.

<br>
<p>To help all enjoy the holidays in moderation, Anita Wong, MPH, RD, CDN, CDE, Clinical Nutrition Manager at NYC Health + Hospitals/Metropolitan offers these healthy holiday eating tips for the Host and the Guest.

<h2><span class="underline">For the Host</span></h2>
<p>If you are hosting a gathering, here are some ways to lighten up your recipes without sacrificing taste.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Substitute applesauce for oil, margarine or butter in cupcakes, muffins and quick breads such as banana bread. Try substituting a small amount at first, as the more you substitute the more the texture of the finished product changes.</li>
		<li>For dips, use fat-free yogurt.</li>
		<li>Use sliced almonds as a delicious, crunchy topping for salads or deserts.</li>
		<li>Choose reduced-fat or low-fat cheeses for salads and casseroles.</li>
		<li>Stock up on fresh vegetables including sweet potatoes, winter squash, broccoli, carrots and green beans. Apples, cranberries and pears combine easily for a tasty salad or fruit crisp.

</ol>

<h2><span class="underline">For the Guest</span></h2>
<p>If you are a guest at a dinner party or other gathering, try these tips to keep healthy, happy and safe.</p>

<ol>
	<li>	Start your day with a breakfast that includes whole grains, fruit, vegetables and protein.</li>
	<li>Don’t starve yourself beforehand. Rather, eat a small meal or snack so you aren’t tempted to overeat.</li>
	<li>Don’t rush to eat. Socialize and settle into the festivities before you eat.</li>
	<li>Savor foods you truly enjoy and pass up on those that don’t really interest you.</li>
	<li>Move away from the buffet or appetizer trays. This will minimize the unconscious nibbling.</li>
</ol>
